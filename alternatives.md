### Status Quo: Duplicated Logic

Because the Bitcoin Cash virtual machine (VM) does not currently support definition and invocation of reusable functions, existing contracts must duplicate all re-used logic, significantly increasing contract lengths and resulting transaction sizes.

By eliminating duplicated bytecode, contract lengths can be optimized for a wider variety of use cases: finite field arithmetic, pairing-based cryptography, zero-knowledge proof systems, homomorphic encryption, post-quantum cryptography, and other important applications for the future security and competitiveness of Bitcoin Cash.

### Status Quo: Sidecar Inputs ("Emulated `OP_EVAL`")

The delegative capabilities offered by `OP_DEFINE`/`OP_INVOKE` have been available on Bitcoin Cash since the [2023 upgrade](https://cashtokens.org/docs/spec/chip), allowing contract systems to delegate authority to arbitrary, user-specified contracts via [identity tokens](https://cashtokens.org/docs/spec/examples#identity-tokens) provided in a sidecar input (A.K.A. "emulated `OP_EVAL`").

For example, consider a simple upgradable vault: each UTXO may be spent if a previously-approved condition is revealed and satisfied – much like [Taproot](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki), but without the limitation that conditions must be specified prior to UTXO creation. This configuration allows unused spending paths to remain hidden (via P2SH), improving privacy and/or operational security and reducing the byte length of some transactions<sup>1</sup>.

Today, this kind of upgradable vault may be created by e.g. locking funds in UTXOs which inspect a sibling input for authorized tokens (`<2> OP_UTXOTOKENCATEGORY <EXPECTED_CATEGORY> OP_EQUALVERIFY`), delegating control to the contract(s) which currently hold those tokens<sup>2</sup>. Authorized tokens can then be distributed across multiple contracts, participate in other contract systems, and/or be moved independently from the locked funds.

#### Improved Privacy and Operational Security vs. Status Quo

While the status quo allows unused spending paths for these vaults to remain hidden, the existence of other spending conditions and related metadata (e.g. the total number of conditions, timing and frequency of past activity, the contents of previously-revealed contracts controlling identity tokens, etc.) are revealed by any vault spend<sup>3</sup>. Because this proposal would allow direct delegation within a contract, vaults can be designed to avoid leaking such details, improving overall privacy and operational security.

#### Improved Efficiency and User Experience vs. Status Quo

This proposal also reduces transaction sizes vs. the status quo, especially for spends of [P2S](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-p2s) contracts. As emulation currently requires a sidecar input, this proposal saves at least 41 bytes per use vs. the status quo<sup>4</sup>. Within P2S contracts, this proposal allows contracts to hide unused code paths in the same and similar ways as is currently available via P2SH; for these cases, this proposal also avoids the need for an intermediate transaction (spending an intermediate P2SH contract) to emulate this behavior. In practice, this both reduces the operational complexity of contracts – an atomic transaction avoids the need for additional network monitoring, timing management, and error handling (e.g. partial block inclusion) – and reduces cumulative transaction bandwidth by at least 65 bytes per occurrence<sup>5</sup>.

#### Notes

1. Note that identity tokens are also more powerful than Taproot or signature-based delegation in that identity tokens also enable **revocation** of previously-approved spending conditions. E.g. if an employee leaves a company, their keys may be revoked from thousands of different UTXOs without moving (or even revealing the redeem bytecode of) those UTXOs; instead, only the identity token must be moved to a new contract in which the revoked key is not a participant. (The new identity token contract can likewise delegate and/or hide unused spending conditions via sidecar inputs or `OP_DEFINE` + `OP_INVOKE`.)
2. To prevent P2SH UTXOs within such vaults from being associated prior to spending (for privacy and/or operation security), a nonce may be included in the redeem bytecode (e.g. `<NONCE> OP_DROP`).
3. If their redeem bytecode includes a nonce, unspent UTXOs in the same vault may still remain unassociated, hiding the "current balance" of the vault.
4. The additional transaction input adds [a minimum of 41 bytes](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-vm-limits/blob/master/rationale.md#selection-of-input-length-formula). This proposal may enable additional efficiencies in specific cases, but to simplify comparison, we assume both strategies would authenticate the evaluated bytecode in the same way, e.g. comparison against a 32-byte hash, validation of a 65-byte signature, etc.
5. The minimum byte length of the intermediate transaction (following `CHIP-2021-01 Minimum Transaction Size`).

### Alternative: Multi-Byte `OP_DEFINE` and `OP_INVOKE` Opcodes

This proposal's `OP_DEFINE` and `OP_INVOKE` operations adopt the existing pattern of all other non-push operations – and the defined functions themselves – by accepting parameters from the stack. This approach maximizes the power and flexibility of each operation, simplifies transpilation from other languages to Bitcoin Cash VM bytecode, reduces contract lengths, and avoids breaking modifications to bytecode parsing (which would require wider ecosystem software modifications beyond VM implementations). See Rationale: [Use of Stack-Based Parameters](./rationale.md#use-of-stack-based-parameters).

### Alternative: BIP12 `OP_EVAL`

[BIP12 `OP_EVAL`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0012.mediawiki) was proposed in 2011, and shared the basic behavior of this proposal: pop and evaluate the top stack item. BIP12 differed from this proposal in several ways:

- **Didn't preserve stack frames in the control stack**:
  - BIP12 didn't specify interaction with other control flow behavior (at the time, `OP_IF/OP_NOTIF/OP_ELSE/OP_ENDIF`); depending on the implementation, this would allow control flow structures to extend across multiple evaluations.
  - This proposal instead enforces consistent boundaries around existing and future control flow structures (e.g. [loops](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-loops)), simplifying both consensus implementations and developer tooling.
- **Limited evaluation depth to 2**:
  - BIP12's nesting limit would hamper the overall usefulness of functions by preventing deeper composition, requiring additional duplication and/or stack manipulation of code in many cases.
  - While the [existing control stack depth limit](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-vm-limits/blob/master/rationale.md#retention-of-control-stack-limit) of still 100 applies to this proposal, relatively few computations employ deeper nesting for optimal factoring.
- **Prevented use of `OP_CODESEPARATOR`**:
  - BIP12 required implementations to specifically scan each evaluated script for instances of `OP_CODESEPARATOR`, rejecting the transaction if found. This needlessly increases implementation complexity and eliminates some potential value: [`OP_CODESEPARATOR` remains a useful feature](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-vm-limits/blob/master/rationale.md#ongoing-value-of-op_codeseparator-operation) for certain use cases and has been preserved by past upgrades (e.g. [`OP_ACTIVEBYTECODE`'s support for `OP_CODESEPARATOR`](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-2022/blob/master/CHIP-2021-02-Add-Native-Introspection-Opcodes.md#op_activebytecode-support-for-op_codeseparator)).
  - This proposal avoids the additional implementation complexity and preserves the usefulness of `OP_CODESEPARATOR` within evaluations.
- **Cleared the alternate stack**:
  - Though not specified, a BIP12 implementation also [cleared the alternate stack](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/729#issuecomment-3294453) at the end of each evaluation. At best, this behavior is useless: because each alternate stack item requires one byte to push (via `OP_TOALTSTACK`), any program which employed the stack clearing behavior could just as easily have replaced these bytes with equally or more efficient dropping operations (`OP_DROP`, `OP_2DROP`, or wider [stack clearing](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-vm-limits/blob/master/rationale.md#increased-usability-of-multisig-stack-clearing)). Further, preventing functions from accepting or returning values in the alternate stack would limit their byte efficiency by requiring less efficient stack juggling strategies vs. the higher semantic bandwidth of passing both stacks.
  - This proposal does not implicitly clear the alternate stack after each evaluation.

Overall, this proposal benefits from many years of additional information, research, and clarification of constraints vs. BIP12, which had little visibility into yet-to-be-developed use cases, today's wider contract ecosystem, future introspection operations (especially `OP_ACTIVEBYTECODE`), [CashTokens](https://cashtokens.org/), or the [modern VM limits](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-vm-limits).

### Alternative: CHIP 2024-12 OP_EVAL: Function Evaluation

An earlier iteration of this proposal, `CHIP 2024-12 OP_EVAL`, enabled similar behavior via a single `OP_EVAL` opcode. The `OP_EVAL` approach enables an optimization saving up to 3 bytes per non-inlineable function given optimal stack scheduling. However, practical application of the optimization requires considerable implementation cost in ecosystem software, exposes optimized contracts to additional toolchain risks, and may ultimately have a zero-byte impact on transaction sizes. See [Withdrawing `OP_EVAL`](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/chip-2024-12-op-eval-function-evaluation/1450/91?u=bitjson).

### Alternative: Output-Level Function Annex

Another potential (partial) alternative to this proposal is the addition of a per-output function annex, perhaps using a "`PREFIX_FUNCTIONS`" encoding and deployment strategy similar to the [token-encoding `PREFIX_TOKEN`](https://cashtokens.org/docs/spec/chip#token-prefix) codepoint, coupled with an "`OP_INVOKE`" operation (this could share the `PREFIX_FUNCTIONS` codepoint).

Solutions in this category often have some combination of the following drawbacks:

- **Disallow hiding of unused spending paths** – If the solution forces the contents of unused function definitions to be exposed at spending time, the approach would limit the proposal's [privacy and operational security benefits](#improved-privacy-and-operational-security-vs-status-quo).

- **Prevent some cross-input deduplication** – If the solution forces P2SH inputs to specify function definitions within the same input, the approach would prevent some contract systems from minimizing transaction sizes, by e.g. evaluating bytecode contained by a [sidecar input](#status-quo-sidecar-inputs-emulated-op_eval) (authenticated via a hash, signature, or token category and/or commitment).

- **Increase implementation complexity** – If the solution requires a new transaction-level data structure and associated validation rules, the approach would increase the complexity of validating implementations. Increasingly specialized solutions in this category (e.g. [BIP341](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki)) likewise tend to increase the risk of protocol-level technical debt.

Overall, this proposal considers `OP_DEFINE`/`OP_INVOKE` to be more capable and efficient in the long term – minimizing protocol debt.

### Alternative: OP_EXEC

Another potential alternative to this proposal is [`OP_EXEC`](https://web.archive.org/web/20250117180758/https://www.nextchain.cash/op_exec.md), a variation on `OP_EVAL` which attempts to improve contract security by defining additional limitations around stack usage ("stack isolation") and recursion (to a depth of 3).

The `OP_EXEC` proposal misunderstands the relevance of "stack isolation" to contract security<sup>1</sup>, has no known or theoretical advantages vs. `OP_EVAL`, and even if optimized to be less wasteful per-invocation, would 1) significantly increase the byte length of all contracts<sup>2</sup>, and 2) [share `OP_EVAL`'s other disadvantages vs. `OP_DEFINE`/`OP_INVOKE`](#alternative-chip-2024-12-op_eval-function-evaluation).
