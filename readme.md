## Summary

This proposal introduces the `OP_DEFINE` and `OP_INVOKE` opcodes, enabling Bitcoin Cash contract bytecode to be factored into reusable functions.

## Motivation & Benefits

- **Reduced transaction sizes** – By eliminating duplicated bytecode, contract lengths can be optimized for a wider variety of use cases: finite field arithmetic, pairing-based cryptography, zero-knowledge proof systems, homomorphic encryption, post-quantum cryptography, and other important applications for the future security and competitiveness of Bitcoin Cash.

- **Stronger privacy and operational security** – By enabling contract designs which leak less information about security measures, current assets, and transaction history, this proposal [strengthens privacy and operational security](./alternatives.md#improved-privacy-and-operational-security-vs-status-quo) for a variety of use cases.

- **Improved auditability** – Without reusable functions, contracts are forced to unnecessarily duplicate significant logic. This proposal enables contracts to be written using more succinct, auditable patterns.

## Deployment

Deployment of this specification is proposed for the May 2026 upgrade.

- Activation is proposed for `1763208000` MTP, (`2025-11-15T12:00:00.000Z`) on `chipnet`.
- Activation is proposed for `1778846400` MTP, (`2026-05-15T12:00:00.000Z`) on the BCH network (`mainnet`), `testnet3`, `testnet4`, and `scalenet`.

## Technical Specification

The virtual machine is modified to add a [Function Table](#function-table) of immutable functions, the `OP_DEFINE` opcode is defined at codepoint `0x89` (`137`), and the `OP_INVOKE` opcode is defined at `0x8a` (`138`).

### Function Table

The virtual machine (VM) is modified to add a new data structure: the `Function Table` is a data structure (such as a map or sparse array) that holds immutable byte vectors; it maps each defined function identifier to an immutable function body (the byte vector).

Due to VM limits, the function table does not exceed [Maximum Cumulative Depth](#maximum-cumulative-depth-max_cumulative_depth) in length/count, and the function table's held byte vectors do not exceed the the [Stack Element Length Limit](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-vm-limits?#increased-stack-element-length-limit).

#### Defined Function Count

A `Defined Function Count` counter is added to track the count of defined functions.

#### Function Identifier

A function identifier – the function's index in the [function table](#function-table) – is an integer greater than or equal to `0` and less than [Maximum Cumulative Depth](#maximum-cumulative-depth-max_cumulative_depth) (currently, `1000`).

#### Maximum Cumulative Depth (`MAX_CUMULATIVE_DEPTH`)

The existing cumulative stack and altstack depth limit (A.K.A. `MAX_STACK_SIZE`; 1000 items) is modified to incorporate `Defined Function Count`: the sum of stack depth, alternate stack depth, and `Defined Function Count` must be less than `1000`.

##### Notice of Possible Future Expansion

While unusual, it is possible to design pre-signed transactions, contract systems, and protocols which rely on the rejection of otherwise-valid transactions made invalid only by specifically exceeding one or more current VM limits. This proposal interprets such failure-reliant constructions as intentional – the constructions are designed to fail unless/until a possible future network upgrade in which such limits are increased, e.g. upgrade-activation futures contracts. Contract authors are advised that future upgrades may raise VM limits by increasing [Maximum Cumulative Depth](#maximum-cumulative-depth-max_cumulative_depth), or otherwise. See [Limits CHIP Rationale: Inclusion of "Notice of Possible Future Expansion"](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-vm-limits/blob/master/rationale.md#inclusion-of-notice-of-possible-future-expansion).

#### Reset Before Locking Bytecode Evaluation

After the evaluation of unlocking bytecode and prior to the evaluation of locking bytecode, the [`Function Table`](#function-table) and [`Defined Function Count`](#defined-function-count) must be reset (to an empty table and `0`, respectively). Note that this reset 1) does not occur prior to Pay to Script Hash (P2SH) redeem bytecode evaluation and 2) non-push unlocking bytecode (including `OP_DEFINE`) is currently invalid, so implementations may choose to omit explicit enforcement of this behavior.

### `OP_DEFINE`

```CashAssembly
<function_body> <function_identifier> OP_DEFINE
```

The `OP_DEFINE` opcode is defined at codepoint `0x89` (`137`) with the following behavior:

1. Pop the top item from the stack to interpret as a function identifier (a VM Number between `0` and `999`, inclusive).<sup>1</sup>
2. Pop the next item from the stack to interpret as the function body<sup>2</sup>, and copy it to the [function table](#function-table) at the index equal to the function identifier. If that function index is out of range or already defined, error.<sup>3</sup>
3. Increment `Defined Function Count` by one, increment [Operation Cost](http://github.com/bitjson/bch-vm-limits#operation-cost-limit) by the length of the function body (in addition to the [Base Instruction Cost](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-vm-limits?#base-instruction-cost)).

<small>

#### `OP_DEFINE` Clarifications

1. If the stack is empty (no `function_identifier`), error. If the popped item is not a VM Number between `0` and `999` (inclusive), error. See [Rationale: Use of Stack-Based Parameters](./rationale.md#use-of-stack-based-parameters) and [Rationale: Use of Positive Integer-Based Function Identifiers](./rationale.md#use-of-positive-integer-based-function-identifiers).
2. if the stack is empty (no `function_body`), error. Note that any stack item is a valid function body (including empty stack items); implementations must not attempt to parse the function body until invoked by `OP_INVOKE`. See [Rationale: Deferred Parsing of Function Bodies](./rationale.md#deferred-parsing-of-function-bodies).
3. See [Rationale: Immutability of Function Bodies](./rationale.md#immutability-of-function-bodies). Note also that function identifiers/table indexes may be defined in any order. See [Rationale: Support for Skipping Function Identifiers](./rationale.md#support-for-skipping-function-identifiers).

</small>

### `OP_INVOKE`

```CashAssembly
<function_identifier> OP_INVOKE
```

The `OP_INVOKE` opcode is defined at codepoint `0x8a` (`138`) with the following behavior:

1. Pop the top item from the stack to interpret as a function identifier.<sup>1</sup>
2. Preserve the active bytecode (A.K.A. `script`), instruction pointer (A.K.A. program counter or `pc`), and index of the last executed code separator (A.K.A. `pbegincodehash`) by pushing them to the top of the control stack.<sup>2</sup> (Note that this subjects function invocations to the existing control stack depth limit of `100`.)
3. Reset the instruction pointer and last executed code separator, then execute the function body as if it were the active bytecode.<sup>3</sup> If the bytecode is malformed (i.e. a push operation requires more bytes than are available in the remaining segment of bytecode to be parsed), error.
4. When the evaluation is complete<sup>4</sup>, restore the original bytecode, instruction pointer, and last executed code separator, then continue evaluation after the OP_INVOKE instruction.<sup>5</sup>

<small>

#### OP_INVOKE Clarifications

1. If the stack is empty (no `function_identifier`), error. If the popped item is not a VM Number representing a previously-defined function in the [function table](#function-table), error. If the referenced function body has a length of zero: error if the control stack depth limit of `100` would be exceeded by a non-empty evaluation; otherwise, continue after the `OP_INVOKE` instruction.
2. Note that this requires the control stack to be capable of holding a new **stack frame** data type to preserve the state of the parent evaluation.
3. `OP_INVOKE`ed bytecode otherwise shares the context of the parent evaluation:
   1. Invoked functions may modify the stack and alternate stack without limitation, and control stack usage (e.g. `OP_IF/OP_END_IF` or further `OP_INVOKE`s) within the evaluation remains restricted by the 100-item depth limit.
   2. Executed `OP_CODESEPARATOR` operations record the index of the current instruction pointer (A.K.A. `pc`) within the `OP_INVOKE`ed bytecode as the last executed code separator (A.K.A. `pbegincodehash`).
   3. The `OP_ACTIVEBYTECODE` operation produces the serialization of the active bytecode beginning from the last executed code separator.
   4. In signature operations, the covered bytecode includes only the active bytecode beginning from the last executed code separator (or if none have been executed in the current evaluation, the full active bytecode).
4. For an `OP_INVOKE` evaluation to complete successfully, the top element remaining on the control stack must be a stack frame to resume after the evaluation. (E.g. Validation fails if an `OP_IF` within the evaluation is not resolved by a matching `OP_ENDIF` within the same evaluation.)
5. After an active bytecode has been fully evaluated, the next stack frame is resumed (restoring its bytecode, instruction pointer, and last executed code separator values) until all stack frames are complete (the control stack is empty) or the evaluation has produced some error. Note that two or more `OP_INVOKE` operations may be resolved within the same virtual machine step (e.g. if a child `OP_INVOKE` is the final instruction of a parent `OP_INVOKE` evaluation).
